A Wiki? Yeah!

> [http://wiki.mroberts.me/](wiki.mroberts.me)

Full disclosure: I totally stole this idea from [Wesley](http://blog.tahnok.me/), but it has helped me study for Psychology so far so I am going to run with it. We spend so much time writing these notes things, why shouldn’t we do something with them?

If someone in my classes finds these, it might be useful to them, maybe no one will but having to type them out and format them forces me to re-read them and that’s studying. #BrainHack

Also, I have decided to add in as much supplemental material as I can, pictures / links to articles / Wikipedia, to make the notes as complete as possible.

> In my PSYC*2390 class, my prof mentioned how the depth cue of occlusion was one of the first used by artists, dating back to Egyptian art. In that section of the notes, I added a link to an Egyptian painting that illustrates that.

Hopefully I will keep this up, but it may stagnate when I get super busy, and as for my classes from previous semesters… If I ever get super bored, I might put them up, but it won’t have the studying incentive, so it might be later rather than sooner.

Tech Specs: I’m using [DokuWiki](http://www.dokuwiki.org/), which is a fairly simple wiki platform designed with PHP and uses files as storage not a DB (for easy backups - just copy the wiki folder), has revision control, has a fair amount of plugins to increase functionality and allows for ACL enough to satisfy me (keep them griefers away [Minecraft reference]). It also features a simplified syntax similar to [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/), which I prefer to WYSIWYG.

I debated keeping it publicly editable in case someone wanted to add additional information to my notes, but I realized that they would stop being my notes in that case, and I want to be in control of them. That being said - if someone wants to join, send me an email and I will give you an account. If someone other than me joins, I will add some type of talk page feature (using the aforementioned plugins) so we can discuss before we edit each other’s pages.
